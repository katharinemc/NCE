						<p><span class="businessname">Dr. Newman</span> received her undergraduate degree in English from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La.; her Master of Arts degree in Speech Communication from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La.; and her Doctorate of Communications from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida. She has held faculty appointments at Miami University of Ohio, College of Notre Dame, University of Maryland, and Bishop Dennis J. O'Connell High School.</p>

              <p>Dr. Newman's dissertation, entitled Competition Among Women, revealed that traditional women compete more with other traditional women while androgynous women cooperate with other androgynous women. "Family Weekly" published an article in 1978 relating to Dr. Newman's research because the findings related directly to the Glass Ceiling and other issues affecting the upward mobility of women.</p>
         
              <p>Dr. Newman's work career includes positions as Director of Graduate Financial Aid at Georgetown University, Congressional Liaison for the Commission on Security and Economic Assistance (Carlucci Commission), and Public Relations Consultant for Reagan Bush '84. She has developed training programs for Arlington County's Adult Education Program and for several private and federal sector training organizations. She has participated in several national training team negotiations with the International Association Of Chiefs Of Police and Johnson & Johnson Associates.</p>
