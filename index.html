                   <div class="js-initial">
                  <p><span class="businessname">Dr. Maggie Newman</span> received her undergraduate degree in English from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La.; her Master of Arts degree in Speech Communication from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La.; and her Doctorate of Communications from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida. She has held faculty appointments at Miami University of Ohio, College of Notre Dame, University of Maryland, and Bishop Dennis J. O'Connell High School.</p>
        
                  <p>Dr. Newman's dissertation, entitled Competition Among Women, revealed that traditional women compete more with other traditional women while androgynous women cooperate with other androgynous women. "Family Weekly" published an article in 1978 relating to Dr. Newman's research because the findings related directly to the Glass Ceiling and other issues affecting the upward mobility of women.</p>
             
                  <p>Dr. Newman's work career includes positions as Director of Graduate Financial Aid at Georgetown University, Congressional Liaison for the Commission on Security and Economic Assistance (Carlucci Commission), and Public Relations Consultant for Reagan Bush '84. She has developed training programs for Arlington County's Adult Education Program and for several private and federal sector training organizations. She has participated in several national training team negotiations with the International Association Of Chiefs Of Police and Johnson & Johnson Associates.</p>

            <dl>
                <dt> What is NCE's training history and experience?</dt>
                <dd class="hidden">
                    <p>In 1988, Dr. Newman formed Competitive Edge, a small, woman owned training business. The mission of Competitive Edge is to provide organizations with the "best in the business" in communication, customer service, team building, management, supervisory and pre-retirement training.

Focusing on the 21st Century, she is actively involved in innovative facilitative training designed to help organizations create solutions. Her tireless efforts to communicate employee and management needs generate win-win strategies at all organizational levels.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Newman has written and developed several communications and motivational workshops including the following programs: Improving Communications Skills; Team Building For Managers and Secretaries; Critical Thinking and Critical Reading; Techniques Of Supervision For Law Enforcement Agencies; Projecting Professionalism; Interviewing Techniques; Effective Briefing Techniques; Effective Briefings and Presentations; Goal Setting To Achieve Results; Assertiveness Training; Problem Solving Techniques For Managers; Writing, Proofreading and Editing For Secretaries; Performance Management; Effective Writing For Professionals; Fundamentals Of Memo Writing and Grammar; and Stress Management. This prospectus includes a current list of course outlines.</p>
               
                     <p>Competitive Edge has trained managers to build teams and communicate more effectively with their employees. Seminars encourage discussion, interactive communication strategies, role playing, and group discussions. Programs include personality, learning, listening, and communication styles; responsibilities of supervisors and managing change.</p>
               
                    <p>Contingent on individual client needs, new courses and seminars continue to be added. Should you require any specific changes, please contact Competitive Edge at (703) 533-3372 to arrange a consultation.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt> How does NCE deliver an experiential, results-oriented training experience?</dt>
                <dd class="hidden">
                    <p>When possible, our approach to delivering an experiential, results-oriented training experiance is to meet with, and interview management and team leaders to assess the effectiveness of the current methods of operation, communication, customer service, quality teams as well as the organizations ability to change and to achieve its mission.</p>

                    <p>Method/Process: Provide framework via lectures, videotapes, and interactive team discussions. In teams, we use questions to focus teams on key issues. Teams answer questions and develop action plans.</p>
                    
                    <p>Techniques/Tools: Train and motivate personnel to facilitate teams and implement techniques by providing handouts and encouraging role plays. The instructor "leads by example" by facilitating and focusing team members to stay on the topic to "solve" the organizational concerns/changes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Skills: Effective communication, team building, customer service skills, conflict management, negotiation skills and strategies are reinforced contingent upon which course is being Taught.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt> What is the largest group of individuals NCE can train at one time?</dt>
                <dd class="hidden">
                  <p>The largest group of individuals would be 100 participants. This arrangement works for two hour seminars, or pre-retirement training seminars (2-3 days).</p>
                </dd>
                <dt> Are pre-planning and analysis important to training goals and objectives?</dt>
                <dd class="hidden">
                  <p>  Pre-planning and analysis are critical to achieving our client's objectives. Meeting with and discussing the goals, objectives and vision of the organization and the key players provides the facts and framework for the entire program. Our goal is to facilitate the teams and provide assistance to keep the teams focused on achieving their primary purpose.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>How does NCE conduct pre-planning and analysis?</dt>
                <dd class="hidden">
                  <p>If possible, we would meet with training coordinators or management to determine the key issues to be addressed and suggest a workable format contingent on the size of the group and the complexity of the issues to be resolved. Together we would determine the appropriate format, questions and time frame for achieving our combined goals. We also provide outlines of our current "off-the-shelf" courses for immediate review and implementation.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Will there be follow-up?</dt>
                <dd class="hidden">
                    <p>Yes, we suggest a follow-up every quarter to determine how effectively the teams are "staying the course," if the client deems this necessary to corporate communications and ongoing training. If not, we continue to provide "off-the-shelf" courses.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt> What is ballpark fee for a training program from NCE?</dt>
                <dd class="hidden">
                  <p>All fees are negotiable, but these are our average figures;
                    $2,000 per day, including expenses for up to 30 participants.</p>
                  </dd>
                <dt> Does NCE have specific experience in providing training in communication skills? Organizational mission and visioning? Team training? Customer service? Organizational change? Pre-Retirement?</dt>
                <dd class="hidden">
                    Since 1988, Competitive Edge has continued to receive outstanding evaluations for providing communication, customer service, team building and supervisory skills training to thousands of federal employees and managers.
